## About The Project

This is a 2D RPG platformer I created in Unity for my final project in my game development course. It is really just a beta but shows much of what I learned in the course. The game features various levels, enemies, player attacks, and power-ups.

The gameplay includes different levels such as the menu screen, tutorial level, first level, and boss level. Each level offers unique challenges and obstacles for the player to overcome.

The player has different attacks to choose from, including a basic melee attack, a jab attack, and a magic fireball attack. Each attack has its own mana cost and affects the player's movement in different ways.

In addition to attacks, the player can perform jumps. The player starts with two jumps, with the second jump costing mana and allowing for higher jumps.

The player also has the ability to sprint, which costs mana but allows for faster movement. However, sprinting can only be done while the player is on the ground.

Power-ups play a significant role in the game. There are various power-up items available, such as apples, bananas, kiwis, melons, oranges, pineapples, strawberries, and cherries. Each power-up item provides different effects, such as increasing health, granting mana, giving damage buffs, or permanently enhancing health and mana.
